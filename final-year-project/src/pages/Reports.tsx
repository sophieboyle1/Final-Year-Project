          <p>
            This section provides a detailed breakdown of the technical work that powered the A&E data analysis and prediction models. While the A&E Data Page highlights key findings, this page focuses on the behind-the-scenes processes: how raw NHS data was cleaned, enhanced, and transformed into a structured format suitable for machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll find explanations on how missing months were handled, how synthetic values were generated, what feature engineering techniques were applied, and why these steps were crucial for producing accurate and reliable predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            All cleaned and engineered data was prepared locally, exported as JSON, and then hosted on Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. The frontend application fetches this data dynamically at runtime, ensuring that visualizations and predictions are based on up-to-date, structured datasets — without hardcoding values.
